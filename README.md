# CodoLingo Backend

CodoLingo is an Android-based app designed to teach beginners the fundamentals of Python. Users can complete a series of interactive exercises, including multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop activities, and fill-in-the-blank challenges. The app starts with the basics, such as data types in Python, and progresses to more complex topics like loops and functions. Users can track their progress, compare it against their friends and climb the leaderboard by earning points.

This app uses MongoDB for data storage and Express for building the backend server.
